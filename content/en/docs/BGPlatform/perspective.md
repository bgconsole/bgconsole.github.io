The BG Platform is composed of multiple perspectives that are in a nutshell, the view your are seeing in the main window.
The first perspective you will see is the Desk which is the one that helps you manage your profiles, workspaces and projects.
The BG Console is indeed a perspective but of a special kind as you are about to discover.

The BG Platform provides a powerful mechanism to switch easily and navigate between the perspectives.

There are three types of perspectives:
* The main perspective, the Desk is one of them. It can run only once.
* The project perspective, BG Console is one of them. You can run as many BG Console as perspective as projects you have.
* The component perspective, it is a panel usually used by a project or main perspective to show or edit information.
